# Parse completed_requests.json data

Ensure you install libraries before running the script 

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script using

```bash
python3 main.py completed_requests.json
```

#### All the processed files will be placed in `processedCRFiles` directory, ensure that you remove a pre-existing processed directory(otherwise the data will be appended to the existing files) before running the above command again.

Note: I recommend running the script locally using the latest version of the Python 3 interpreter
